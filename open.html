<em>24 April 2020</em>
<p>I want here to begin to form an understanding of the relationship between what I do now and what I used to do, of why I was drawn to a new mode of creative work, and of how I might reflect on what I’m learning. My two worlds find common ground in curiosity, ingenuity, and the assembly of language and ideas — but diverge in their circumstances.</p>
<p>Among the reasons I left academia was a dissatisfaction with the fundamental loneliness of the process of writing, and the limited opportunities for truly sustained collaboration. Teaching and scholarship are communal, but rigidly so, and the natural competition between ideas and their articulation is too often elided into a more aggressive form of competition between people. My journey into unfamiliar territory was motivated from the start by the search for a place where intellectual endeavour and a collaborative atmosphere might coexist.</p>
<p>Pairing, the practice of working in concert with another person, has been a revelation. To work as one of a pair is to be located in an unconventional social situation and a cognitive space rich in the interplay of ideas. It is such a lively marketplace of conceptualizations about potential paths of activity, that almost everything comes down to a relation between people and the judgements they reach together. When pairing is not the technique applied, that conceptual landscape unfolds inside a single mind — an alternative state of creative fulfilment that has its own, quite different, attractions. But that is a topic for another time. I am interested here in interaction. The appealing puzzle of the pairing scenario is how to adjudicate, together, between competing interpretations and visions. This involves understanding and working with each other, making it both an intellectual and social challenge.</p>
<p>The processes of co-construction that take place during pairing are myriad and sometimes, I have discovered as a learner, quite profound. The rewards of writing in this way are embedded in the small moments of exploring, asking, teaching, learning, explaining, influencing, persuading, and imagining, where knowledge is contested and consolidated. Such moments have arisen for me noticeably more frequently than they did in academia, where a more regulated (and hierarchical) environment imposes all kinds of institutional constraints on their form and occurrence, tending towards orchestrated performances in rarefied settings, and limits on the modes of knowledge and fields of inquiry in which it is permitted to traverse.</p>
<p>The contemplative cadence and seasonality of the academic enterprise suits a particular temperament, and it has suited mine at times. The duration over which material is explored and arguments drawn out, enables those arguments to become deeper, and to be prosecuted with fuller force. In turn, their presenter can expect to have them met with, and interact with, a crowd of others that have been similarly carefully crafted — whether that communication takes place in the pages of a journal or in the conversations conjured by papers at a conference. Moreover, they participate in a wider scholarly exchange that the disciplines have established and codified over time.</p>
<p>This is a welcome ideal; when realized, it confers a special advantage to the academy as a haven for intellectual activity, for sorting out good (even useful) ideas from bad ones. But these choreographed meetings of minds did not always live up to their potential, and the advantage of their seriousness and depth did not outweigh the disadvantage of their irregularity. Too infrequently to persuade me to remain in the university realm did I feel I was present in a moment of acute engagement, where one mind acts adjacent to another, and where many minds work together at once in an interconnected environment. Too delayed or unreliable was the payload of a return loop of feedback to inform original thinking and make it go further. The activity of writing software yields trivially smaller insights at each moment, but with more consistency and greater regularity.</p>
<p>I do not mean to imply that this work does not also involve a lot of tedious, routine procedures, like regurgitating the obvious filler required by a framework, or satisfying the verbose demands of a language’s type system. Nevertheless, it is rare that an hour passes without at least one genuine moment of discovery, surprise, feeling of advancement, or motion of some kind (it may prove to be backwards). Despite or because of the necessity for this element of mechanical labour, another analogous intellectual skill is also in play: the refinement of focus. It has been wisely observed that one important thing that distinguishes good software developers is where their focus is. But collaboration performs a contrasting role here too.</p>
<p>It is an ever-present danger for those with a certain cast of mind to get lost in a playground of gratuitous complexity, satisfying one’s own curiosity only, and not a higher goal. Locality has a special importance, whether it is in the optimization of some module, or in prospecting for the next decision, on which a certain degree of focus needs to be appropriately trained. That’s the kind of focus from which a state of immersion follows: being in the moment, “the zone”, a place or mindspace with the feeling of direct attachment to the object of the work itself, in almost a tactile sense. It is a phenomenological experience, a communion with the object being worked on, or with, as the painter or the pianist might encounter.</p>
<p>Yet there is a cost to being in this sublime condition. It is so closely connected with the present moment that only with some uncomfortable dislocation can the image of another reality — an imagined, future state — be accommodated: the vision that materializes in a comprehensive configuration, where all the elements interweave.</p>
<p>Keeping this in mind is part of the delicate dance of invention. There is a deep skill in maintaining attention on the horizon of holistic, emergent form, while profiting from the immersive cycle of incremental motivation that keeps the engine of creativity alive. The particular captivation of writing software as a social practice rests on the openness of this multilayered process to collaborative input. What follows in these pages will be an attempt to illuminate and give form to these intricacies.</p>
