<h1><a href="/">“imperfect but published”</a></h1>

<p>Since the early 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee has maintained in public an archive of notes on the philosophy, design, and architecture of the global hypermedia information system that he invented in 1989. The later items have carried a header indicating their editorial status (“incomplete first draft”, “good enough”, and so on). When, in early 2010, as a researcher in the humanities, I became aware of the promise of semantic linked data for organizing knowledge, I discovered <a href="https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html">his note on the topic</a> headed with a phrase that immediately caught my eye and my attention. It captured something important for me, an inexperienced writer afflicted by perfectionism. Now, after several years of academic underactivity, and more recently having changed industry, from higher education to technology, it seems to have become the right time to have my own words appear online with the same optimistic caveat: imperfect, but published.</p>
